App to check whether one to one mapping exists between 2 strings.

Run main.js while passing 2 strings as arguments.
If one to one mapping exists, output will be true.
If it does not, output will be false.

Eg. One to One mapping exists between 123 and 321 as each character in 123 can be mapped to a characted in 321 in order.
It does not exist in 113 and 321 as the character '1' in 123 cannot be mapped to both '3' and '2'.
